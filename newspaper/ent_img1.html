            The highly anticipated film OMG 2, starring Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar and Pankaj Tripathi, has unveiled its first devotional song titled ‘Oonchi Oonchi Waadi.’ The song pays homage to Lord Shiva and features both the lead actors.
            <br><br>
The music is composed by Hansraj Raghuwanshi, Raahi, and Djstrings, and Raghuwanshi has also sung it. The heartfelt lyrics are penned by Hansraj and Djstrings, along with Kabeer Shukla.
<br><br>
The song’s video opens with Pankaj Tripathi’s character, a devout follower of Lord Shiva, praying in a serene temple setting. He shows his unwavering devotion by singing bhajans and cleaning the temple halls in his free time. The storyline takes a dark turn when Pankaj’s son faces problems in adjusting to a new school. In a scene, he is also seen standing on a railway track, hinting at a suicide attempt. However, Akshay Kumar’s portrayal of Lord Shiva comes to their rescue and gives them strength to overcome this difficult phase of their life.
<br><br>
In his earlier tweet, Akshay Kumar had asked blessings for the film’s success. He wrote, “Need your blessings and wishes for #OMG2, our honest and humble attempt to reflect on an important social issue. May the eternal energy of Adiyogi bless us through this journey.”
<br><br>
OMG 2 is the sequel to the 2012 hit film Oh My God, which starred Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, Mithun Chakraborty and Mahesh Majrekar in pivotal roles. OMG 2 is directed by Amit Rai, who also has the writing credit of the film to his name. OMG 2 will hit the silver screen on August 11. Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel’s Gadar 2 and Rajinikanth’s Jailer will also release on the same day, leading to a box office clash.
