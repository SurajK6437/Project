        <b><label for="">Form your own party instead of staking claim to NCP, Sharad Pawar faction tells defectors

            The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faction led by Sharad Pawar on Monday urged the defectors led by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to form their own political party. It asked the Ajit Pawar faction to make its ideology public instead of creating confusion among citizens by claiming the right over the party formed by his uncle Sharad Pawar.
            <br><br>
            “Those who have left the NCP should not stake claim over the party as Sharad Pawar formed it. In the past, when senior Pawar had left the Congress, he formed his own party and never staked claim over the Congress. When Raj Thackeray quit the Shiv Sena, he did not stake claim to the party and instead built his own MNS (Maharashtra Navnirman Sena) party. Those who have split from NCP, citing their differences with the party chief on joining hands with BJP, should form their own party and also declare their party’s ideology,” said NCP state spokesperson Vikas Lavande.
            <br><br>
            Lavande said there was no meaning in stealing a political party from the one who built it, and if the defectors consider them to be stronger, they should establish their own party. The NCP spokesperson said Sharad Pawar will be on a statewide tour to take on the rebels and strengthen the party base with renewed energy.
            <br><br>
            Ajit Pawar has since then repeatedly taken swipes at Sharad Pawar, suggesting that it was time for him to make way for young blood. Ajit also staked a claim to the NCP by announcing that he would take the party name and symbol as he enjoys the support of most of the party MLAs.
