        <b><label for="">The Supreme Court held as illegal the third extension granted to the Enforcement Directorate chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra and curtailed his extended tenure to July 31.

        <label>The Supreme Court Tuesday held as “invalid in law” the extension of tenure given to the Enforcement Directorate Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra beyond September 8, 2021, the cut-off date fixed by it.<br>
                <br>
            A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Vikram Nath, and Sanjay Karol upheld the amendments made to the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003, after the September 8, 2021, ruling, saying extension can be granted to high-level officials such as the ED director in the public interest and with reasons in writing.<br>
            <br>
            The bench said the scope of judicial review into administrative action is very limited and can happen only on three grounds—when the legislature lacks competence to make the law, when it affects fundamental rights, or when there is manifest arbitrariness.
            <br><br>
            In the instant case, the legislature was competent to do so, said the bench, adding no fundamental rights had been violated and there is no manifest arbitrariness. However, it added though Parliament can take away the basis of a judgement, it cannot nullify the mandamus, or an order from a court to a government official ordering them to fulfil their official duties properly, that said no further extension beyond September 8, 2021.
            <br><br>
            The Centre had contended that Mishra was given the extension due to the pending peer review by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
            <br><br>
            Taking this into consideration, the SC allowed Mishra to continue until July 31.
            <br><br>
            Hearing a batch of petitions challenging the third extension given to Mishra, the Supreme Court had in May said it might revisit its 2021 ruling that the tenure of a superannuated officer may be extended only in exceptional circumstances.
