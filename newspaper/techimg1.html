            A couple of months ago, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, admitted he didn’t “fully understand” how the company’s AI chatbot Bard works. He said the programme spoke in a foreign language that it wasn’t trained to know. The “revelation” instantly grabbed big, bold headlines, triggered numerous opinion pieces, and intensified discussions about AI.
            <br><br>
            But soon after, experts such as Margaret Mitchell, a computer scientist and former employee of Google, shed light on the fact that Bard was trained to give prompts in the language concerned. At the centre of the controversy was Bengali. All she did was look at the datasheet of PaLM, Google’s large language model (LLM), which had been incorporated into the chatbot, to find Bengali as one of the foreign languages that it already knew.
            <br><br>
            With her expertise, some digging and a healthy dose of scepticism, Mitchell quickly deflated Pichai’s assertion that Bard had some sort of “superpower” to automatically learn unexpected new skills. As it turned out, the whole episode was yet another attempt to perpetuate AI hype, which came into centre stage in November last year with the launch of ChatGPT.
            <br><br>
            The forces behind fuelling this hype are major tech companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft. In recent months, they have left no stone unturned in convincing people that generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT are soon going to usher in an AI revolution. They believe such software will transform computer programming, healthcare, marketing, transportation, journalism and even therapy.
            <br><br>
            Their tall claims haven’t fallen on deaf ears. They have, in fact, got many researchers and entrepreneurs worried as they fear that the generative AI tools will quickly become “superhumanly smart” — replacing the equivalent of millions of full-time jobs, taking over the world, and risking nuclear war. Such proclamations, however, ring hollow.
